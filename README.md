Unfortunately, for some reason, when shrink a page, it doesn't shrink properly, except "call to action" section and footer. It seems this problem can be <em>almost</em> fixed by deleting divs with classes "â„–-part", i.e. containers that contain all elements on the respective section of the page. But in that case there is no center alignment.
